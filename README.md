# CryptoClustering
Unsupervised Learning MOD 19 (week 19)

This challange will use Python and unsupervised learning to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes. 

# Part 1
Prepare the Data

Use the StandardScaler() module from scikit-learn to normalize the data from the CSV file.
Create a DataFrame with the scaled data and set the "coin_id" index from the original DataFrame as the index for the new DataFrame.

## Find the Best Value for k Using the Scaled DataFrame
Use the elbow method (Scree plot) to find the best value for k using the following steps:

1. Create a list with the number of k values from 1 to 11.
2. Create an empty list to store the inertia values.
3. Create a for loop to compute the inertia with each possible value of k.
4. Create a dictionary with the data to plot the elbow curve.
5. Plot a line chart with all the inertia values computed with the different values of k to visually identify the optimal value for k.

What is the best value for k? 
4

## Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the Scaled DataFrame

1. Initialize the K-means model with the best value for k.
2. Fit the K-means model using the scaled DataFrame.
3. Predict the clusters to group the cryptocurrencies using the scaled DataFrame.
4. Create a copy of the scaled DataFrame and add a new column with the predicted clusters.
5. Create a scatter plot using hvPlot as follows:
    a. Set the x-axis as "price_change_percentage_24h" and the y-axis as "price_change_percentage_7d".
    b. Color the graph points with the labels found using K-means.
    c. Add the "coin_id" column in the hover_cols parameter to identify the cryptocurrency represented by each data point.

# Part 2
## Optimize Clusters with Principal Component Analysis
Using the original scaled DataFrame, perform a PCA and reduce the features to three principal components.

Retrieve the explained variance to determine how much information can be attributed to each principal component.
    What is the total explained variance of the three principal components? 
    89.50% (0.3719856 + 0.34700813 + 0.17603793 = 0.89503166, 0.89503166 Ã— 100 = 89.50%)

Create a new DataFrame with the scaled PCA data and set the "coin_id" index from the original DataFrame as the index for the new DataFrame.

## Find the Best Value for k Using the PCA DataFrame
Use the elbow method on the scaled PCA DataFrame to find the best value for k using the following steps:

1. Create a list with the number of k-values from 1 to 11.
2. Create an empty list to store the inertia values.
3. Create a for loop to compute the inertia with each possible value of k.
4. Create a dictionary with the data to plot the Elbow curve.
5. Plot a line chart with all the inertia values computed with the different values of k to visually identify the optimal value for k.

What is the best value for k when using the scaled PCA DataFrame?
4 
Does it differ from the best k value found using the original scaled DataFrame?
No

## Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the PCA DataFrame
Use the following steps to cluster the cryptocurrencies for the best value for k on the PCA DataFrame:

1. Initialize the K-means model with the best value for k.
2. Fit the K-means model using the scaled PCA DataFrame.
3. Predict the clusters to group the cryptocurrencies using the scaled PCA DataFrame.
4. Create a copy of the scaled PCA DataFrame and add a new column to store the predicted clusters.
5. Create a scatter plot using hvPlot as follows:
    a. Set the x-axis as "PC1" and the y-axis as "PC2".
    b. Color the graph points with the labels found using K-means.
    c. Add the "coin_id" column in the hover_cols parameter to identify the cryptocurrency represented by each data point.

What is the impact of using fewer features to cluster the data using K-Means?
Clustering with PCA allows for better clustering and visual analysis of changes in crypto prices. It allows us to visualize better which coins are more volatile to daily/weekly price changes (Celsius-degree Tolken and Ethlend) and which ones are more stable.
